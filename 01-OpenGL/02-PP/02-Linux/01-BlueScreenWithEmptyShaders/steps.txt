How to get a OpenGL core-profile-complient context:
(the following algorithm has its roots in the Apple's former GPU manufacturer, Imagination's SDK)

1. add PP-related attributes to the framebuffer attributes array;

2. retrieve ALL available framebuffer configurations from XWindows;

3. from those available, choose the one that supports PP and best suits your application;

4. retrieve the PP-complient XVisualInfo from the chosen configuration;

5. retrieve the address of that glXContext-creating function which support the creation of the chosen FB attributes;
    (since this function is not declared in the header, YOU must wrangle it from the loaded OpenGL driver libraries)

6. create glXContext-related PP attributes, particularly the version and the profile;
    (if OpenGL fails to get you the context, then fallback to the default older PP-supporting context)

7. if you find the context you wished for, check if hardware-rendering is supported or not (i.e. are you running on native drivers
    or on software-drivers).
