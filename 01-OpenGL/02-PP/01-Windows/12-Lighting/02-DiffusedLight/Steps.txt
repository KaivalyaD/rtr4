Definition of the Normal Matrix:
orientation-only part of the transposed inverted model-view matrix.
[i.e. (1st 3 rows) x (1st 3 cols) of transposed inverted model-view matrix]

Step 1:
calculate eye co-ordinates by multiplying position with model-view matrix;

Step 2:
calculate normal matrix from model-view matrix;

Step 3:
calculate transformed normals by multiplying supplied normals with the normal matrix and normalizing;

Step 4:
calculate source light direction by subtracting eye position from light position and normalizing;

Step 5:
calculate color of the diffused light using the following equation:

	L = Ld * Kd * (s.n)

	[L : color of the diffuse light]
	[Ld: supplied diffused light color]
	[Kd: color reflected by the material]
	[s : source light direction]
	[n : object normal]
